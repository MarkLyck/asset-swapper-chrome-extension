asset-swapper-chrome-extension
===============================

A chrome extension that allows you to swap asset files or urls on any website. Useful for example when you need to debug a site and want to inject an unminified version of JavaScript.

Icons are shown to visualize what type of asset you're redirecting.

You can use wildcards(*) to replace e.g. file hashes so you don't have to update it everytime a new build is run.
